# Integrating into H3: the blocker is a 37-key suffix mask

The kernel is verified faster in isolation (872 ms vs 1166 ms, 1.34x) and the
backend patch is in place and imported. It does not fire, and this records why.

## The patch

`h3_910a_attn.py` gained `_flash_usable()` and a guarded branch in
`forward_npu` that routes to `fa910a.flash_attention_910a()` when the shapes
match, falling back to the dense path on any exception. The module imports
correctly and `_flash_usable` returns False rather than raising, so nothing
breaks -- the fast path is simply never taken.

## What the runtime actually passes

Instrumented the guard to log every distinct attention shape. Two appear:

```
shape=(1, 56, 3, 128)   causal=False  mask=none
    -> the text encoder (S=3), correctly rejected: not tile-divisible.

shape=(1, 7, 63232, 128) causal=False mask=shape=(1,1,1,63232) dtype=bool
    -> the DiT, which is the one we care about.
```

The DiT shape matches the kernel's contract exactly: `(B=1, H=7, N=63232, D=128)`
fp16. But it carries a boolean key mask, and the contents are:

```
ones = 63195 / 63232      first0 = 63195      suffix_padding = True      zero_cnt = 37
```

So it is **pure suffix padding**: the first 63195 positions are valid and the
last 37 are padding. That is the whole obstacle.

Note 63232 = 256 * 247, so `Bc=256` divides it and the kernel would be fast on
this shape. The sequence length is also shorter than the 73408 seen at 10 s,
confirming N varies with clip length, so tiles must be picked per call.

## Why the three obvious escapes do not work

1. **Ignore the mask.** It is not a no-op: 37 keys are genuinely masked, and
   including them changes the softmax denominator. Would be silently wrong.
2. **Truncate to the 63195 valid keys.** The kernel needs both tile dimensions
   to divide N. `63195 = 5 * 3 * 4213` has no factor of two at all, so no
   16-aligned tile divides it. The kernel cannot run on the exact valid length.
3. **Pass the mask to the kernel.** The reference does accept `attn_mask`, but
   `attention.py:51` documents it as `(1, N, N)` or `(B, N, N)` fp16 -- a dense
   additive mask. At N=63232 that is 63232^2 * 2 B = **8 GB**. Infeasible.

## The exact fix that would work

Because the mask is suffix padding and only 37 keys are involved, the result can
be corrected rather than masked:

1. Zero the V rows of the 37 padded keys, so their contribution to the numerator
   becomes 0 and the numerator stays exact.
2. Run the kernel on the full 63232 (tile-divisible).
3. The kernel already returns `l` = log-sum-exp over all keys, so its output is
   `numerator / (den_valid + den_pad)`. Recover `den_pad = sum over the 37 keys
   of exp(s_j)` from a tiny `Q @ K_pad^T` matmul -- `Nq x 37 x 128`, cheap.
4. Rescale: `O = O_kernel * exp(l) / (exp(l) - den_pad)`.

That is exact, needs only a small extra matmul, and keeps the fast kernel for
the 63232-length case.

A simpler variant worth trying first: since the padded keys are a contiguous
suffix and there are only 37, check whether the harness always pads to a fixed
total per clip length. If so, the padded keys' K rows may be zeros, in which
case `s_j = 0` for all q and `den_pad = 37 * exp(0) = 37` exactly -- no matmul
needed, just a constant. That should be checked before building the general
correction, because it would make the fix trivial.

## Status against the objective

* "支持 910A 的 flash attention": **done**. Builds, runs, matches fp32 to fp16
  rounding at both the small and the real shape, and is 1.34x faster per call
  than the dense path.
* "加速 H3 推理": **not yet**. The kernel is never invoked inside H3 because of
  the mask above, so there is no end-to-end speedup to report. The per-call gain
  is real but unrealised.
